# EDA-on-London-Air-Quality-
conducted an exploratory data analysis on London's air quality using hourly pollutant measurements of NO2, NO, NOx, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5, collected from 34 monitoring sites over a year.Using R statistical software, I visualized key insights, including:
- Temporal behavior of pollutants across different months
- Identification of the most polluted sites in London
- Correlation analysis among different pollutants
The findings highlighted significant pollution spikes during January and December, likely due to increased domestic heating and traffic congestion. The Wandsworth - Putney High Street area was identified as a critical pollution hotspot, mainly due to heavy bus traffic.
